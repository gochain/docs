# Running an Authorized Signer Node

This directory contains instructions for configuring and running an authorized signer node on either the GoChain `testnet` or `mainnet`.

## Prerequisites

Install `docker` and `docker-compose`.

* Docker > 25.0 ([install](https://docs.docker.com/install/))

## Initial Configuration

\**Note: If you are moving from the testnet to the mainnet, it is best to start fresh in a new folder.*

A complete configuration looks like:
```
|-config.toml
|-docker-compose.yml
|-.env
|-node/keystore
|-password.txt
```

1. Copy `config.toml` and `docker-compose.yml` into your folder from either the [`testnet`](testnet) or [`mainnet`](mainnet) directory.
2. Create a file `password.txt` with your password.
3. Create an account for reward activities. Note the logged address.

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/root ghcr.io/gochain/gochain gochain --datadir /root/node --password /root/password.txt account new
```

4. **Backup the `node/keystore` directory you just created! If you lose it, you will lose all of your rewards!**
5. Create a file `.env` to set the required variables: (see [`example.env`](example.env) for more details and optional variables)
```
GOCHAIN_ACCT=0x12345 # Use the address from step 3.
GOCHAIN_EXTRADATA="My Company Name" # Each signed block will have this permanently included.
NETSTATS_NAME="My Company Name" # Display for netstats web interface.
NETSTATS_SECRET=secret # Ask the GoChain team for this secret.
```
6. Launch `docker compose`

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

7. Make sure that node works. Note the `enode` address logged on startup. 
(The `enode` can also be retrieved by [attaching to the console](https://github.com/orgs/gochain/discussions/154) and executing `admin.nodeInfo.enode`)

```sh
docker logs -f node
```

8. **Backup the `node/GoChain/nodekey` file!** - This determines your enode public key.
9. Contact the GoChain team with your account address and enode (with IP address) to be added to the list of signers.
