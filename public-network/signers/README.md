# Signer Information Sheet

[Current signers](https://github.com/gochain/docs/blob/master/public-network/signers/mainnet-signers.md)

## What is a GoChain Signer?

A GoChain signer is a company/entity that is given the privilege of signing blocks in the GoChain network based on our Proof of Reputation consensus.

## What’s in it for a Signer?

* Publicly supporting the cause of a greener, more decentralized blockchain network
* 7 GO per block signed
* Blocks are signed every 5 seconds
* Even distribution amongst all signers
* ~44M new GO awarded per year
* Early signers earn more due to the network being smaller

## Company Requirements

To get accepted as a GoChain signer, you must meet some minimum requirements. All of these are compared with other nodes in the network to decide if your company would be a good fit.

* Annual recurring revenue
* Number of employees
* Years in business
* Funding level
* Public/private

## Recommended System Requirements

You'll need a machine with the following specifications or greater:

* 32GB RAM
* CPU - typically, a 32GB machine will have enough CPU to handle it
* SSD drives with at least 200GB of space
* Network - any modern data center/cloud provider should have sufficient network bandwidth

## Testnet QA

Before you will be accepted into the mainnet, you must be able to run a node on our testnet
under heavy load for at least a week. You will be added as a signer to the testnet and a week long
load test will run to ensure you are capable of operating and maintaining your node.

## Ongoing Governance

Every signer must be able to run, manage and operate their server(s) at the following
minimum SLA requirements:

* 3 9's of uptime - 8.76 hours of downtime maximum per year
* 24/7 on call with 2 hour response times (emergency responses should be fairly rare, but availability must be ensured)

If a node cannot keep up with these requirements, they may be immediately voted out.

If a signer must be removed for other reasons, such as a more reputable company coming online, there
will be a 30 day grace period before being voted out. Signers must also give 30 days notice before voluntarily leaving.

## Node Signer Company Requirements

* 10+ people as full time employees.
* 1MM+ in yearly revenue.
* Actively building, researching, or contributing to blockchain and education in the broader marketplace.
* Stated and implemented purpose and use for GO collected from signing on GoChain’s mainnet.
* Designated representative to oversee the correct implementation, and operation of the signing node, as well as any general contributions to GoChain as a business previously agreed to by either party, or any concerns that arise at the time of engagement and thenceforth.

## Potential Disqualifications for Removal from Network

* Generally malicious and/or illicit business activity.
* Disparaging remarks or presentations of GoChain, blockchain (or crypto currency in general) to the general marketplace, GoChain clients, business partners, or competitive businesses, and protocols.
* Actively encouraging companies to build on a different blockchain protocol.
* A lack of consistent and transparent communication with the GoChain team regarding company mission, benchmarks, and direction.
